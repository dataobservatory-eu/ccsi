It was opened in 2003 and has since become a popular destination for concerts, theater performances, gastronomic manifestations, literature evenings, discussions and film screenings, and exhibitions. Over 1.5 million people have attended events on the ship, which has featured more than 10,000 artists and performers over the years.
