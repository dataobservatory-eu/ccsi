`ESCP Business School` is a transnational business school that has urban campuses in Germany, France, Great Britain, Italy, Spain, and Poland. It is the oldest business school globally, having been established in 1819, and celebrated its 200th anniversary in 2019. ESCP is affiliated with the Regional Chamber of Commerce and Industry Paris Ile-de-France, and as of January 1, 2018, it has been an EESC (Établissement d’enseignement supérieur consulaire). It receives support from the Berlin Government (Senate), Berlin Chamber of Commerce, as well as the Turin Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Agriculture, and Crafts Industry.

It is among 1% of multi-accredited business schools worldwide and is regularly ranked among the world’s best business schools. ESCP Business School welcomes 9.000 students in degree programmes and 5.000 learners in executive education programs from more than 122 different nations every year. 

ESCP increasingly supports interdisciplinary research conducted with non-management disciplines, facilitated by its numerous academic alliances and partner universities. Having close ties with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Berlin and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Paris, ESCP is part of the vast international network of industry partners, companies and enterprises in different sectors and can act as a valuable validation partner and a liaison between higher dedication institutions and business. ESCP is also part of the European entrepreneurial ecosystem and supports European entrepreneurs through its own Blue Factory start-up incubator, as well as teaching and research accomplished by the members of the European Jean-Baptiste Say Institute for Entrepreneurship.

ESCP Business School has particular expertise in 3 key academic areas, namely sustainability, entrepreneurship and digitalisation with a foundation of international management.

Several of teaching programmes are completely dedicated to the digital sphere, i.e. the MSc in Sales 4.0; the MSc in Strategy and Digital Business, or the Executive Master in Digital Innovation and Entrepreneurial Leadership.
