The **Institute for Information Law** ([IViR](https://www.ivir.nl/about-us/)), officially established in 1989, is one of the largest research centers in the field of information law in the world. The Institute employs over 25 researchers who are active in an entire spectrum of information society related legal areas: intellectual property law, patents, telecommunications and broadcasting regulation, media law, Internet regulation, advertising law, domain names, freedom of expression, privacy, digital consumer issues, commercial speech, et cetera.

In July 2014 the Institute celebrated her 25th birthday with an international conference called [Information Influx](http://www.ivir.nl/influx/). The Institute engages in cutting-edge research into fundamental and topical aspects of information law, and provides a forum for critical debate about the social, cultural and political aspects of regulating information markets. The Instituteâ€™s international orientation is reflected in its international staff as well as various international co-operations and partnerships. Adding to the international atmosphere of the Institute, visiting scholars from all over the world regularly spend time at the Institute. The Institute for Information Law is affiliated with the [Faculty of Law](http://www.uva.nl/en/disciplines/law) of the [University of Amsterdam](http://www.uva.nl/en/home).
