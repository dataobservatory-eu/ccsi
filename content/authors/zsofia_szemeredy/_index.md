Zsofia is a script development executive and sustainability professional.
Over the past decade, she worked for a variety of mainstream and independent film companies. Throughout the decade, she gained hands-on knowledge and experience across multiple sectors including: public relations, festivals and markets, sales, distribution, exhibition, and script development. Following her attendance at the National Film and Television School, she discovered her true passion lay in combining script development and sustainability, and finding a balance between the two in both her work and personal life.
