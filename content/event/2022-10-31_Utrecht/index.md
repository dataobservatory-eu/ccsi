summary: Introducing the collaborative data observatories with the example of the music industry and sector.

abstract: 'Big data creates injustice, because only the biggest corporations, universities and governments can sustain long, systematic, and well-organized data collection. Reprex builds collaborative data ecosystems, communities, that can share resources and access legally open but not available data sources. Our flagship products are the Digital Music Observatory and Listen Local, a system that tries to prevent global platforms colonizing local ecosystems with AI.'

Our partner, [MXF](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/project/openmuse/) tries to put the findings into [actionable data services](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/slides/listen-local-lithuania-invitation/) in Lithuania and Ukraine with the help of [MusicAire](https://musicaire.eu/). We develop open tools that can be applied in Utrecht, the Hague, Budapest, Tallinn, [Vilnius](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/slides/lll-mic/), [Bratislava](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/slides/openmuse-bratislava/), or anywhere." numbered="false" >}}</td>

Our ongoing project since 2014 is [Listen Local](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/project/listen-local/).  We would like to find out how can a local music ecosystem, or a small scene avoid being colonized by global players on streaming platforms, radio, or in-store music.  How can we make sure that music recommendations connect bands in Utrecht with fans in Utrecht?  If a Polish band is visiting Utrecht, music lovers will find their show?

We are arriving at opening to [Klein Berlijn](https://www.kleinberlijn.de/) at 17.00 where you can sit down with a coffee or a beer to chat. No reservation needed. At 19.30 we are getting on our OV fiets and cycle over to the Vechtclub where we will meet people of the local indie scene, Tiny Rooms, and see two independent bands on stage.

As the sales and promotion of recorded music get fully automated, and even the curation of music for live events gets more and more influenced by machine learning outcomes or social media metrics, how can a DIY label remain relevant?  How you can run a small club or a label without having to invest in a multi-million euro data engineering team?  Make sure that the algorithm will learn successfully your music offering.

Reprex's motto is `big data for all`. We want to fight data inequalities, data monopolies, and make big data and AI work for self-released artists or small labels, too. 

[Gabija](/authors/gabija_liaugminaite/) and [Daniel](/authors/daniel_antal/) are visiting Utrecht to meet DIY musicians, labels, researchers, fans and friends to find new partners for our Listen Local projects. On an intellectual level, we are interested in trustworthy AI, data feminism, and providing a proper digital representation to music and live performances for all.  On a more emotional level, we want to meet musicians and music lovers from the indie scene.

We want to help independent artists to find their next audience, and fans to find their next favorite record or a truly fulfilling live music experience. Gabija had a conversation with [The Kurws]((https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2022-10-26_the_kurws/) ) in our `Listen Local Interviews` series.  She asked the band about where they are coming from, where they want to go?  Where they are local? And what they have to offer to the people who will join us on 31 October 2022 in Utrecht?
