`Greening European Film Policy` (GEFP) explores the burgeoning field of environmentally sustainable - 'green' - production in the European film industries. The project views green production as both an ethical proposition and a means to ensure the competitiveness of the European film industry - under which we include film, television, and streaming media. We position green production as a unique and as-yet unexplored competitive advantage for the film sector, where advanced development, embedding, and dissemination of green production practices is a crucial factor in maintaining the competitiveness, if not the very viability, of the European film industries. 

GEFP focuses on mapping ongoing policy initiatives for green production and evaluate how the dynamics of top-down governance and horizontal policy and communication incentivise, deploy, and assess on-the-ground practice. We collaborate with key stakeholders across the UK and European green film and television sector, including policymakers, environmental consultants, production companies, and creatives to provide policy recommendations to incentivize a more sustainable sector.

{{< spoiler text="Questions for Film Funds and Policies" >}}

- [x] What are the current norms regarding funding and policy requirements around sustainability?
- [x] What challenges do you face in implementing or imposing sustainability policies?
- [x] Are there ways in which you might benefit from more communication or understanding of on-set experience from a sustainability POV?
- [x] Are there ways in which you might benefit from more regional or international collaboration, or is funding an inherently localized issue?
- [x] We mainly talked about sustainability from a production POV so far, where do you think featuring it as part of the storyline has relevance / potential? Is the film fund considering similar changes to what happened internationally (BFI, Eurimage etc.) where the funding applications require to elaborate on any planned sustainable practices?
- [x] What models do you think work well in other countries, that you think would be realistic to implement in the region and what is needed in order to implement it?
