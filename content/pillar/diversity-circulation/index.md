# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary: "Music diversity and circulation is a crucial policy and business goal for European music stakeholders. Most European creators work in small countries, often confined to the audiences of a not widely spoken language; moreover, they are in competition with the entire world via media platforms, streaming services and traditional record sales."

WP2 Music diversity and circulation will culminate in a pilot project conducted in Slovakia, Lithuania, and Ukraine by [SOZA](/authors/soza), [MXF](/authors/mxf), and [MEU](/authors/meu). 

The WP2 pilot project will demonstrate the feasibility of increasing local artist
representation in radio and streaming, via trustworthy AI and evidence-based regulatory policy. In the “Listen Local” project, partners [SOZA](/authors/soza) and [Reprex](/authors/reprex) created the Slovak Demo Music Database (SDMDb) as a reference database to measure the market share of Slovak music in radio and streaming, and created a prototype of a recommendation
system that meets trustworthy AI criteria and is able to achieve similar cultural diversity goals as laid out by Slovak media legislation in 2015: i.e., to achieve 15% “Slovak” market share in radio playlists.
