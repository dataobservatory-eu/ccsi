summary: "Survey harmonization is a powerful research tool to increase the usability of questionnaire-based empirical research.  When the same questions are asked from similarly selected German and French people, music audiences and musicians, then we can make meaningful comparisons between the public opinions of the two countries, or the different perceptions of fans and makers of music."

Survey harmonization is a powerful research tool to increase the usability of questionnaire-based empirical research.  When the same questions are asked from similarly selected German and French people, music audiences and musicians, then we can make meaningful comparisons between the public opinions of the two countries, or the different perceptions of fans and makers of music.  And if we repeat this procedure time after time, we can see if opinion is shifting more in Germany or France, or the living conditions of musicians are catching up with the rest of the country population.

- [x]   You can create better surveys with less cost:  you only need to ask the information, or change of information, that is not included in our harmonized datasets. Shorter, better questionnaires, smaller samples sizes, huge cost savings.

- [x]   When you make questionnaire-based research, you immediately get a history (the same question asked years ago) and an international comparison (the same question asked in other countries.)

- [x]   Often you do not even have to pay for the survey, because somebody else has already made a similar taxpayer funded research and we can just get the data for you.
Harmonizing surveys requires advanced data science and statistics knowledge, which is what we provide with the scientific partners of the Cultural Creative Sectors Industries Data Observatory.  We have developed an open-source software, free to use, for this purpose.  It is not for the faint heart – but users of our observatory can just leave their data for us and let us run the code. 

## How can you join this year's survey?

Since 2020, a consortium of nine European universities led by Sant’Anna Pisa is working on the research project reCreating Europe funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme. [reCreating Europe](https://www.recreating.eu/) aims at bringing a ground-breaking contribution to the understanding and management of copyright in the DSM, and at advancing the discussion on how IPRs can be best regulated to facilitate access to, consumption of and generation of cultural and creative products. 

<td style="text-align: center;">{{< figure src="/img/blogposts_2022/CCSID_reCreating_Survey_16x9.png"  caption="If you are a creator yourself, please, [fill out](https://uva.fra1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_23KHcb7E2xqQFNQ) the survey of 2022 in any EU language. If you represent an artist organization, please, make sure that the survey finds its way to your newsletter and [get in touch](https://reprex.nl/#/contact) with us to get the results---and any further data you need for your work." numbered="false" >}}</td>

As a part of this project, the University of Amsterdam is conducting a survey which targets a wide range of creators and performers, including but not limited to musicians, {{< icon name="guitar" pack="fas" >}}

{{% callout note %}} Tpoics covered in the survey: (1) overall experiences with digitization of cultural content; (2) experiences with publishers, platforms and aggregators: contract and market power issues, accessibility, role of algorithms; (3) experiences with reversion clauses in copyright contracts (4) content removal and website blocking, role of algorithms in this; (5) income development over past years: total income, income from creative profession and distribution of sources within profession; impact of Covid and Covid-related support schemes (6) experiences with piracy and plagiarism; (7) competition from AI producing content.{{% /callout %}}

The survey is available in all official EU languages. 

We would appreciate it immensely if you would support this important research by disseminating the call to participate in this study.

The *Digital Music Observatory* and its predecessor, [CEEMID](https://reprex.nl/project/ceemid/), has been working with harmonized surveys for 8 years.  We have compiled the biggest database of interview transcripts with concert audiences (more than 70,000 interviews in all European countries, soon to be extended to more than 100k) and the world’s biggest harmonized survey dataset about music creators (4000 responses from 12 European countries.) We use the Open Data Directive, originally for government-funded research data, recently extended to taxpayer funded scientific research, to access datasets that are invisible for the music industry.
