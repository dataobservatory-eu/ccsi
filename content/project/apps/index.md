**We are building and ecosystem of open data, open software and trustworthy algorithms around our data observatories. We collaborate with scientific software developers, and their communities, such as rOpenGov. Our software tools have many thousand users, but they require coding skills. We will soon start to deploy more user-friendly applications that can be used by sustainability reporting professionals, or lawyers preparing factual green disclosures.**

The first application is developed in our [Eviota](https://greendeal.dataobservatory.eu//project/eviota/) project, which builds a multi-language reporting interface for preventing greenwahsing. It will have a user-frontend for our environmental (and economic) impact assessment software tool, [iotables](https://iotables.dataobservatory.eu/).  The iotables R package implements most of the functionality laid out in the economic and environmental input-output analysis features in the Eurostat and the respective UN statistical technical guidance on the topic.

Please stay tuned -- we will showcase our first app soon.
