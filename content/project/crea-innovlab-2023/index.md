`DataInnoLab` is a cooperation of 6 innovative SMEs and startups, a non-profit cultural venue and non-profit cultural heritage organization and ESCP, a leading European Business school which aims to support two important Creative Europe strategic objectives.

1.  `DataInnoLab` wants to increase the competitiveness and economic potential of the cultural and creative sectors, in particular the audio-visual sector, in a way that mainstreams environmental and social sustainability management.
2. We also want to help the development and promotion of European cooperation on cultural diversity and heritage in a way that removes institutional, technical, and semantic barriers between the cooperation of the commercial music and audiovisual industry and the music and audiovisual heritage organizations and their supporting institutions.

The DataInnoLab Consortium aims to provide business development tools for the music and audiovisual industry and its supporting heritage and other organizations to leverage the existing instruments of the Culture and Media Strand of the Creative Europe program and the broader New European Bauhaus instruments with higher market revenues and better access to green financing, green investments and insurance. 

Our innovators bring into this project early stage products, prototypes, and open source software that can be further developed, packaged into services which are tested in multiple European markets, and eventually scaled for the entire EU internal market and beyond.
 
In this project, European innovative startups and SMEs will work with the ESCP Business School, a transnational business school for higher education with urban campuses in Germany, France, Great Britain, Italy, Spain and Poland, and its prestigious Blue Factory, its transnational start-up incubator. Established in 1819, ESCP is the world's oldest business school and celebrated its 200th anniversary in 2019. ESCP Business School has particular expertise in three key academic areas, namely sustainability, entrepreneurship and digitalisation with a foundation of international management.
