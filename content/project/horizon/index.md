summary: "We want to avoid the strategic mistake to build parallel knowledge graphs and solutions for the cultural and creative industries for new, current content, and other organizations for managing `heritage` value digital content. We believe that almost all digital representations of cultural heritage, by design, carry some authors’ rights (copyright) or neighboring rights’, and therefore participate in contemporary rights  management."

We want to avoid the strategic mistake to build parallel knowledge graphs and solutions for the cultural and creative industries for new, current content, and other organizations for managing `heritage` value digital content. We believe that almost all digital representations of cultural heritage, by design, carry some authors’ rights (copyright) or neighboring rights’, and therefore participate in contemporary rights  management.



## HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-01-03: Re-visiting the digitisation of cultural heritage: What, how and why? 

>Digitisation of cultural heritage can bring many benefits. In terms of preservation, accessibility and of supporting cultural and creative innovation, digitised cultural heritage can be an enormous asset. One of the reasons why these large investments are made is that such digitised objects should facilitate a wider, more creative use of Europe’s world-renowned cultural heritage, and the creation of more societal value in Europe and beyond. 

Based on our extensive experience with music, and dealing with digital objects, we aim the CCSI Observatory to provide tools for other cultural sectors to offer legal digital representations of their collections. Our approach is the connection of existing platforms and tools that work on the basis of the Open Data Directive and various other tools promoted by [Digital Cultural Heritage](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cultural-heritage) strategy. 

We want to avoid the strategic mistake to build parallel knowledge graphs and solutions for the cultural and creative industries for new, current content, and other organizations for managing "heritage" value digital content. We believe that almost all digital representations of cultural heritage, by design, carry some authors’ rights (copyright) or neighboring rights’, and therefore participate in contemporary rights  management.  

> Other risks may emerge from the (perceived) loss of control over the use of the digital objects, possibly prompting cultural heritage institutions to limit access to and the use of their digital assets, thus hampering the realisation of the wider societal value digitization is expected to bring.

Our Digital Music Observatory was built patiently over 10 years managing these perceived risks. For example, most recordings of the works of Beethoven, as well as modern notation of his work, midi-files, tutorials, books, and television content are protected by various rights, and therefore the digital representation and its metadata can be found in non-heritage systems.  The strategic role of the CCSI Observatory is to connect such systems both from a technical and a reuse business model perspective. This will result in much private investment into digitization and much better dissemination that non-market-oriented cultural heritage organizations can provide. 


> To the extent possible, projects should build on existing knowledge, activities and networks, notably the ones funded by the European Union. Furthermore, where appropriate projects should establish links and seek synergies with related actions, such as relevant R&I actions funded by Horizon Europe or Horizon 2020. In particular, projects should liaise with the projects funded under the “European cloud platform for museums and other cultural heritage institutions” initiative in the frame of Horizon Europe Cluster 2.

Our CCSI Observatory and its partners are involved in many such projects.

## HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-01-02: Cultural and creative industries for a sustainable climate transition

1. Evidence-based approach(es) on how innovative business models, including use of new technology, can make Europe’s cultural and creative industries (CCIs) true drivers of a sustainable climate transition. 

2. European CCIs better prepared to adapt to and contribute to the climate transition in line with the 2030 goals spelled out under a European Green Deal

> At the same time, the CCIs are characterised by a large and diverse number of chiefly small and micro enterprises, as well as by hefty differences across geographical and sectorial divides. Large parts of the CCIs, thus, lack the capacity to take the necessary measures to adapt to and thrive under the climate transition, not to speak of driving this transition.

Reprex and its partners are working on connected financial and sustainability reporting tools that cover the entire value chain of cultural and creative industries. Our mission is to bring down the cost of such sustainability management tools from about 10,000 euros per organization below 500 euros, which will immediately pay off in case _green bank loans_, _green insurance_ or _green subsidies_ are applied by the user.

> Specific approaches are therefore needed to enable Europe’s CCIs to develop their full potential to support a sustainable climate transition. Projects should develop and validate an economically sustainable model, or a portfolio of approaches, that address this challenge. Proposals should select a suitable set of CCI sector(s), or/and cross-sectoral issues, to focus on, which allow significant impacts to be achieved.

Sustainability management requires significant investment into knowledge, business and environmental information. This is critically difficult to achieve in CCIs, where usually there is no separate IT, data, or sustainability function present in the company due to the small organization size. Reprex is an expert in scaling up the reporting and research needs of CCIs to shared, collaborative solutions via the [Digital Music Observatory](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/), [Green Deal Data Observatory](https://greendeal.dataobservatory.eu/) and the [CCSI Observatory](https://ccsi.dataobservatory.eu/). 


**Open science and scientific software development**

Open Policy Analysis interlinks with the OpenMuse commitment to reproducible science and open scientific software, which are seen as cornerstones of evidence-based policymaking – and which are increasingly becoming not only best practices but requirements in EU-funded research and innovation actions. At the heart of open science are replicability and reproducibility. Whilst replicability (as new evidence comes to the surface, it corroborates earlier statements) has always been a requirement of scientific results, reproducibility is relatively novel in practice: it refers to the ability of an entire research process to be re-run easily by an independent auditor. This increases transparency and quality control.

This revolutionary functionality is made available through the iterative development of the UTU project rOpenGov, a sophisticated set of open-source data collection and analysis tools written in the programming language R (Lahti et al. 2017). Several rOpenGov tools were co-developed with REPREX specifically for use in the music industry. The current toolkit includes:

* [eurostat](https://ropengov.github.io/eurostat/), the headline product of rOpenGov, which provides reproducible access to the Eurostat data warehouse, containing more than 3000 users.
* [iotables](https://iotables.dataobservatory.eu/), which produces GVA, employment, tax, and greenhouse gas emissions indicators for the music industry and other industries using data from Eurostat and the European Environmental Agency, counting with several hundred users globally.
* [regions](https://regions.dataobservatory.eu/), which corrects NUTS boundary information and automatically corrects regional datasets, with more than 500 global users.
* [retroharmonize](https://retroharmonize.dataobservatory.eu/), which allows the recycling of surveys, and the execution of more efficient new surveys, has about 200 users globally.
* [spotifyr](https://www.rcharlie.com/spotifyr/), which wraps the Spotify API and allows access to streaming data, and is maintained by our Consortium members since mid-2021 (after the original developer joined Spotify); it has about 1500 music research users.
* [statcodelists](https://statcodelists.dataobservatory.eu/) will help your use of standardized statistical codelists, which allows to share or syncronize data in a natural language independent way.
* [dataset](https://dataset.dataobservatory.eu/) will create interoperable FAIR datasets that conform with the Statistical Data and Metadata Exchange and the W3C web standards, release your data in in open science repositories and place them on knowledge graphs.
