**OpenMuse** brings together music industry stakeholders and researchers from 12 European countries. Our partners represent the diversity of the industry, as well as the shared need to find financially, socially, and environmentally sustainable policy and business models in multiple, sometimes-fragmented streams (e.g., live music, composers/publishers, and recordings with producers and performers).

Good policies require supporting evidence, and good business planning and copyright exploitation require high-quality data. `OpenMuse` will provide such data through novel, open-source tools that leverage automation to enable transfer to nearly any European market. We will disseminate our data via “live policy documents” and visualisations hosted on our Open Music Observatory, which automatically update when data sources are refreshed. This will set a concrete precedent and a clear path towards a more competitive, fair, and sustainable European music ecosystem.

## Open collaboration
Our project is based on open collaboration.  Our Horizon Europe grant will provide us with resources to supply further music businesses, music civil society organizations and researchers with high-quality data (during the duration of the project for free.)  We are already looking for interested parties to put our data and research projects into use and validate their usability and quality in real-life policy or business development scenarios.

## Ambition

OpenMuse aims to contribute to the aim of creating a decentralised European intelligence hub where centralised data collection and analysis have failed in the music industry during the past 20 years. 

We envision the Open Data Observatory as a decentralised, complementary service to the ESSnet system (Eurostat and the national statistics offices) and the planned, centralised European Music Observatory (EMO). The Open Data Observatory will be an important supplier of the planned EMO, furnishing it with statistical products (datasets, visualisations), employing similar quality controls (though replacing official quality control with scientific quality control) and providing a high level of service where official and centralised solutions have failed. We plan to implement the Open Data Observatory as an open-source, public-facing solution working in synergy with the EMO. In the event that the EMO does not get created, or it fails, the Open Data Observatory will be positioned to serve many of the same needs.

Our ambition is to create [an ecosystem of statistical software](/#releases) that is interoperable with the systems of ESSnet via the widely-used R statistical environment. On the basis of this ecosystem, we are planning a complementary, decentralised music data and intelligence hub that is complementary to both the centralised functions of the future EMO and the ESSnet. 

This intelligence hub, the Open Data Observatory, has a service level similar to that of the Eurostat Rest API (high-quality data and visualisation products with various statistical quality control available in a Rest API meeting Dublin Core, DataCite, and SDMX interoperability standards). Furthermore, to syncronize real time with the worlds knowledge hubs, we want to offer web 3.0 (semantic web) capabilities and place our resources on music knowledge graphs.

In addition, the Open Data Observatory will fill the gaps in the offering provided by Eurostat and the ESSnet network,due to their non-music specific mandate and cost/benefit analysis.

The Open Data Observatory is partly a statistical software service provider that maintains a software ecosystem (developed in WP4), and partly a solution provider that makes the reproducible open policy analysis method available for various end-user groups represented in our Consortium and beyond. It will create reproducible “[smart policy documents](/apps/smart-policy-documents/)” that can be transferred from one country to another, or scaled up from one country to a group of countries or even the entire European Union, and recast with little effort after the inception of new data every year, due to their very high level of data/output standardisation and interoperability. Instead of creating large budget, ad-hoc valuation reports, these reports, with their automatic data harvesting and processing, can be recast annually with little further investment, or they can be transferred from Hungary to Bulgaria, from Slovakia to Lithuania or even Ukraine, as we plan to showcase.

Having reviewed more than 60 data observatories (in domains such as the audiovisual industry, research on homelessness, alternative fuels, etc.), Reprex started the validation of such a decentralised observatory in the Yes!Deflt AI+Blockchain Lab, the world’s 2nd ranked university-backed incubator. Reprex identified a competetive advantage in leveragingopen knowledge management—distinguishing it from most existing data observatories—and further developed this approach into a working prototype in the [JUMP European Music Market Accelerator](https://reprex.nl/post/2021-12-02-dmo-jump/). Building on the assets and know-how acquired through the geographically-limited results of [CEEMID](/project/ceemid/), Reprex has proven to be able to provide high value services in new areas and territories, one example being the recast of the UK’s streaming policy (Hesmondhalgh et al., 2021).

## Methodological innovation

The Level 3 version of the Open Policy Analysis (OPA) Guidelines gives practical guidance on how to improve the transparency and replicability of policy-making work with a scientific underpinning (BITSS, 2019).

<td style="text-align: center;">{{< figure src="/blogposts_2022/OPA_main_figure_with_source.png" caption="" numbered="false" >}}</td>

The OPA guidelines go farther than current Horizon Europe recommendations, subjecting policy research and deliberation to standards as rigorous as those used in e.g. open-source software development and open science peer review. The guidelines consist of three layers: open materials (i.e., the evidence considered in policy); open analysis (the analytical procedures to which the evidence is subject), and open output (the indicators, recommendations, etc. derived from the analysis). Each level must be fully replicable: e.g., all file structures must be standardized, all data rendered open and labelled, all methods and code open-source, and all outputs traceable to the materials and methods used to reach them. Establishing a clear link between input and output by displaying how the output changes under different assumptions is a key methodological challenge.

<td style="text-align: center;">{{< figure src="/blogposts_2022/Eurostat_using_indicators_way_communicating_captioned.jpg" caption="We will bring novelty into the best practices of statistical indicator development laid out by Eurostat" numbered="false" >}}</td>


OpenMuse uses Open Policy Analysis in its creation of policy-relevant indicators. This entails the development of indicator candidates through workshops with stakeholders and the selection of viable indicators through the unit-testing of data science and computer science, the peer-review of open-source scientific algorithm/software development, the methodological peer-review of science, and eventually user verification from music industry users. Because for each indicator we not only collect data, but write an open-source data collection program, our work is fully transparent and replicable. This means, for example, that beyond the project lifespan, policy researchers could run our open-source software and refresh our indicators automatically. We aim to meet or exceed Eurostat standards around data quality and usability. Our data are documented with SDMX compatible codebooks, and DublinCore and DataCite metadata, ensuring full interoperability. They are available in tidy format for easy importing, and in our Eurostat-like Rest API. Authoritative copies are furthermore placed automatically on Zenodo and OpenAIRE. The data analysis (statistical procedures, etc.) also remains open, per OPA, and goes through scientific peer review.

OpenMuse furthermore ensures that all materials, analyses, and outputs meet the FAIR principles enshrined in Horizon Europe and the EU’s open science agenda, and will be submitted as best practices to the Knowledge4Policy Portal horizontal knowledge areas on Evidence-Informed Policy Making, Composite Indicators, Modelling, and AI Watch. These efforts toward radical transparency will help ensure open deliberation and consensus-forming among stakeholders. Putting evidence-based policymaking into practice in music research, we will establish a precedent for its incorporation as a keystone of the social sciences and digital humanities more broadly.

**Open science and scientific software development**

Open Policy Analysis interlinks with the OpenMuse commitment to reproducible science and open scientific software, which are seen as cornerstones of evidence-based policymaking – and which are increasingly becoming not only best practices but requirements in EU-funded research and innovation actions. At the heart of open science are replicability and reproducibility. Whilst replicability (as new evidence comes to the surface, it corroborates earlier statements) has always been a requirement of scientific results, reproducibility is relatively novel in practice: it refers to the ability of an entire research process to be re-run easily by an independent auditor. This increases transparency and quality control.

This revolutionary functionality is made available through the iterative development of the UTU project rOpenGov, a sophisticated set of open-source data collection and analysis tools written in the programming language R (Lahti et al. 2017). Several rOpenGov tools were co-developed with REPREX specifically for use in the music industry. The current toolkit includes:

* [eurostat](https://ropengov.github.io/eurostat/), the headline product of rOpenGov, which provides reproducible access to the Eurostat data warehouse, containing more than 3000 users.
* [iotables](https://iotables.dataobservatory.eu/), which produces GVA, employment, tax, and greenhouse gas emissions indicators for the music industry and other industries using data from Eurostat and the European Environmental Agency, counting with several hundred users globally.
* [regions](https://regions.dataobservatory.eu/), which corrects NUTS boundary information and automatically corrects regional datasets, with more than 500 global users.
* [retroharmonize](https://retroharmonize.dataobservatory.eu/), which allows the recycling of surveys, and the execution of more efficient new surveys, has about 200 users globally.
* [spotifyr](https://www.rcharlie.com/spotifyr/), which wraps the Spotify API and allows access to streaming data, and is maintained by our Consortium members since mid-2021 (after the original developer joined Spotify); it has about 1500 music research users.
* [statcodelists](https://statcodelists.dataobservatory.eu/) will help your use of standardized statistical codelists, which allows to share or syncronize data in a natural language independent way.
* [dataset](https://dataset.dataobservatory.eu/) will create interoperable FAIR datasets that conform with the Statistical Data and Metadata Exchange and the W3C web standards, release your data in in open science repositories and place them on knowledge graphs.

Unlike Eurostat and many other open and proprietary databases, the [rOpenGov](/authors/ropengov/) tools use tidy data principles. It is often said that about 80% of data analysis is spent on the process of cleaning and preparing the data; the tidy principles are established to standardize, simplify, and speed up this process. Using rOpenGov tools allows difficult-to-read data to be reformatted as clean tables that can be imported with a click to Excel for business analysis, statistical software packages for scientific analysis and data visualization, and databases for automated display and uses. The tools have a proven record in CCSI research: _iotables_, for instance, was used by REPREX to calculate the direct and indirect gross-value added, employment, and effect of the Hungarian tax shelter for film production. _iotables_ were also used by [SOZA](/authors/soza/) and [Reprex](/authors/reprex/) to investigate various policy scenarios for the [Slovak music industry](/publication/slovak_music_industry_2019/). _regions_ were used by UVA in an analysis of regional patterns in [piracy](/publication/scholarly_pirate_libraries_2020/).

OpenMuse will further develop the rOpenGov tools into an open music data software ecosystem that does not require extensive programming skills to use. This software ecosystem will allow the creation of evidence-based “[live policy documents](apps/smart-policy-documents/)” that update automatically as the data sources they are based on are refreshed. It will also make the transfer of research to new sites or topics extremely efficient. For instance: if one were to create a live policy document for Hungary (as in our pilot project), one could reproduce the live policy document in Bulgaria with the same quality and format simply by running Bulgarian data through the backend code. This triple benefit of excellent quality control, comparability, and much-improved time and cost efficiency makes reproducibility a key element in our design for a highly scalable data-to-policy pipeline for European music ecosystems.

**Advanced data science and statistics**

OpenMuse uses advanced data science, and production-side statistical know-how, to access data that are currently unusable by the music industry. We focus on two sources: legally open, but hard-to-access data sources, and big data produced by streaming services.

With regard to legally open data: the price of music goods and services is surveyed by national statistical offices monthly (as components of calculating national inflation rates). Furthermore, high-quality and expensive survey data already exist on music participation (attendance, amateur practices, listening, etc.) via various pan-European surveys such as EU-SILC, ESS, Eurobarometer, and AES. It is possible to secure these datasets using the Open Data Directive; however, they are not often known to the music industry or even music researchers. 

<td style="text-align: center;">{{< figure src="/blogposts_2022/Eurostat_using_indicators_way_communicating_captioned.jpg" caption="We will bring novelty into the best practices of statistical indicator development laid out by Eurostat" numbered="false" >}}</td>

With regard to streaming data:  Our approach draws on SSSA and REPREX competence in quantitative finance methodology. The selectivity bias in streaming data accessible by EU music stakeholders is a problem analogous to the statistical characterization of the price movements, volumes, and return of illiquid, infrequently traded securities, or, symmetrically, in estimating duration models of high-frequency arrival process in discretized continuous time models (Bottazzi et al. 2020). A common-sense example of the application of finance methodology to track price and volume in complex markets with imperfect information is the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which gives accurate guidance on price movements and risk for an entire market, using special averaging and periodical rebalancing of only 30 share prices. Using similar statistical methods, we will identify and track the domestic and international performance of limited baskets of recordings/works that are representative of particular streaming market segments: e.g., Italian emerging artists or Slovak classical performers. This approach was piloted in CEEMID, which created price and volume indexes for 20 European countries to reveal why streaming revenue growth concentrates around the top ca. 1% of rights-holders (Antal, 2020a), and further used in UK policy work related to the parliamentary inquiry into streaming economics (Hesmondhalgh et al., 2021).

**Survey recycling**

National statistical offices currently collect the price of music goods and services monthly. Additionally, high-quality survey data exist on many aspects of cultural access and participation, including music use in general, and even zero-price use – which has no accounting trail, and is thus otherwise difficult to measure. However, these datasets generally require specialist software and competence to access and analyse. They also use numerous formats and labelling strategies. This means that a typical music industry business analyst without data science training cannot integrate them into a meaningful report. Finally, the use of different variables, surveying methods, question phrasings, and response options, among other factors across multiple surveys make comparative interpretations a challenging task. Lack of coordination often leads to redundancy and waste: for example, different entities conducting surveys on overlapping topics, but with incommensurable outputs. This means that despite spending hundreds of thousands of EUR on surveys, national and EU-level policymakers often lack access to reliable and consistent comparative data.

<td style="text-align: center;">{{< figure src="/blogposts_2022/difficulty_bills_levels.jpg" caption="OpenMuse refers to “survey recycling” to describe various practices related to the harmonisation of surveys with different formats and outputs; the statistical matching, integration, or fusion of survey-based data; and the re-use of effective prior survey methods and questions in new surveys." numbered="false" >}}</td>


The ability to “recycle” surveys is a crucial and often missing skill for music market, policy, and scientific research. An important contribution of CEEMID was the successful reuse of open cultural access and participation survey data for all European countries, leading to the creation of ex-ante harmonised, detailed cultural access and participation (CAP) surveys in Hungary, Slovakia, and Croatia. This will allow, for instance, the comparison of cultural access and participation live vs. online before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic, including differences between socio-demographic and values-based segments of the population.

## What Do We Offer To Policy Partners? {#horizon-policy-partners}

We want to demonstrate that we apply world-class research and the best and most data available to solve policy problems. If you bring your policy problem into an open collaboration with our Digital Music Observatory, you can rely on the expertise of eminent researchers in the field of economics, law, royalty finance, statistics, and valuable data. We want to demonstrate that we can offer the best value for money in data. 

We believe that our offering is particularly valuable for music policy organizations who would like to be actively involved in the shaping of the future [Feasibility Study For The Establishment Of A European Music Observatory](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/post/2020-11-16-european-music-observatory-feasibility/). Our Digital Music Observatory already contains much of the data gaps identified by stakeholders.  We have 7 years of working experience in the music industry, and we are familiar with data sharing and data governance solutions that manage well the conflicts of interests and strategic worries of the industry.

## Data Coverage {#data-coverage}

Our research project contributes to all of the expected outcomes of the
call. Our ambition is to develop an open science and open data service
which complements the existing statistical service of Eurostat. In
partnership with key music industry and policy partners, we are going to
fill approximately 41 data gaps within the policy context of *Music
Moves Europe*, as identified by the *Feasibility Study for a European
Music Observatory*, with about 120 high-value indicators. We will
**develop key performance indicators** for music businesses and **policy
indicators** to “better detect the performance of the European music
sector and its contribution to economic and social development, as well
as to sustainability.”

We believe that existing data availability is better than that described
in the *Feasibility study*. As stated in this final report, the 2019
Open Data Directive further extended the availability of re-usable
public sector information (PSI) with open science data. In PSI, open
government data, and open science data, there is a huge potential to
fill in the data gaps without new data collection—the fact that data can
be reused instead of being recollected is the main aim of the directive.
These open data sources are legally open but are not accessible without
further investment; our Consortium wants to make this investment, and
produce about 50% of all the data needs of the future European Music
Observatory.

The [Digital Music Observatory](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/),
which was called [CEEMID](https://reprex.nl/project/ceemid/) at the time
of the creation of the *Feasiblity Study*, has 7 years of experience in
filling in data gaps with open data. It has created metadata maps to
more than 1000 indicators, covering almost all of the data gaps in the
*Feasiblity Study*. We know where to locate data, and now we have to
invest in processing, validating, documenting, and making it available
for the European music sector.

## Pillar 1: Music Economy

In the case of `Pillar 1 – Music & Economy`, we are usually able to
locate the source of the data, and we have some experience in processing
the data and bringing it to light. We have mapped many perceived data
gaps to the various data harmonization projects of GESAC and CISAC, and
we will seek cooperation with these organizations and their members to
find a secure and voluntary way to retrieve the data.

In other cases, we will rely on on the 2019/1024/EU [Open Data
Directive]((https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32019L1024))
to access, process, document, and disseminate the data.

The only data gap that we do not intent do address is the “impact of the
non-profit sector”.

## Pillar 2: Music Circulation & Diversity

We will address the music circulation problems with our WP big data.
Together with our leading statistical experts, data scientists, and
reproducible research experts we will create sampling techniques that
allow to make representative indicators from streaming data. Streaming
data is largely accessible, but not in a representative manner. Using
advanced statistical methodologies like inverse reverse sampling—which
is often used in quantitative finance to analyze large problems—we will
create representative data following our pioneering work made in the
Central European Music Industry Report and later the Digital Music
Creators’ Project initiated by the UK Intellectual Property Office.

We will address diversity issues with recycled and harmonized surveys.

## Pillar 3: Music & Society

We will mainly rely on the integration of existing, but fragmented and
not well-formatted data, and existing, but not processed and not
published data to create pan-European indicators for the music and
society section.

## Pillar 4: Music & Innovation 

1.  We will connect to several innovation topics in music by providing
    research, data, and evidence. Building on the work of the
    [Blockchain & Society](https://www.ivir.nl/projects/blockchain-society/) research
    project of our Consortium member, the Institute for Information Law
    [IViR](https://www.ivir.nl/) at the University of Amsterdam, we will
    address issues related to NFT and blockchain technologies in music.

2.  Connecting to the work of various music stakeholders in Finland, we
    will experiment with the safe data sharing of confidential data,
    avoiding the extreme pitfalls of ‘radical openness’ and ‘closed
    data’. With the University of Bologna, and eight years of experience
    in sensitive data sharing with the [Digital Music
    Observatory](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/) (formerly:
    [CEEMID](https://reprex.nl/project/ceemid/)), we will create various
    statistical methods to create anonymized and synthetic datasets that
    do not endanger business or private data.

3.  We are going to design indicators and carry out a landscape mapping
    with [Music Tech Europe](https://www.musictecheuropeacademy.eu/), a
    new organization that aims to become the representative of music
    startups and music ecosystems in the European Union.
