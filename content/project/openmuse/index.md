Unlike Eurostat and many other open and proprietary databases, the [rOpenGov](/authors/ropengov/) tools use tidy data principles. It is often said that about 80% of data analysis is spent on the process of cleaning and preparing the data; the tidy principles are established to standardize, simplify, and speed up this process. Using rOpenGov tools allows difficult-to-read data to be reformatted as clean tables that can be imported with a click to Excel for business analysis, statistical software packages for scientific analysis and data visualization, and databases for automated display and uses. The tools have a proven record in CCSI research: _iotables_, for instance, was used by REPREX to calculate the direct and indirect gross-value added, employment, and effect of the Hungarian tax shelter for film production. _iotables_ were also used by [SOZA](/authors/soza/) and [Reprex](/authors/reprex/) to investigate various policy scenarios for the [Slovak music industry](/publication/slovak_music_industry_2019/). _regions_ were used by UVA in an analysis of regional patterns in [piracy](/publication/scholarly_pirate_libraries_2020/).

**Advanced data science and statistics**

OpenMuse uses advanced data science, and production-side statistical know-how, to access data that are currently unusable by the music industry. We focus on two sources: legally open, but hard-to-access data sources, and big data produced by streaming services.

With regard to legally open data: the price of music goods and services is surveyed by national statistical offices monthly (as components of calculating national inflation rates). Furthermore, high-quality and expensive survey data already exist on music participation (attendance, amateur practices, listening, etc.) via various pan-European surveys such as EU-SILC, ESS, Eurobarometer, and AES. It is possible to secure these datasets using the Open Data Directive; however, they are not often known to the music industry or even music researchers.

**Survey recycling**

National statistical offices currently collect the price of music goods and services monthly. Additionally, high-quality survey data exist on many aspects of cultural access and participation, including music use in general, and even zero-price use – which has no accounting trail, and is thus otherwise difficult to measure. However, these datasets generally require specialist software and competence to access and analyse. They also use numerous formats and labelling strategies. This means that a typical music industry business analyst without data science training cannot integrate them into a meaningful report. Finally, the use of different variables, surveying methods, question phrasings, and response options, among other factors across multiple surveys make comparative interpretations a challenging task. Lack of coordination often leads to redundancy and waste: for example, different entities conducting surveys on overlapping topics, but with incommensurable outputs. This means that despite spending hundreds of thousands of EUR on surveys, national and EU-level policymakers often lack access to reliable and consistent comparative data.

<td style="text-align: center;">{{< figure src="/blogposts_2022/difficulty_bills_levels.jpg" caption="OpenMuse refers to “survey recycling” to describe various practices related to the harmonisation of surveys with different formats and outputs; the statistical matching, integration, or fusion of survey-based data; and the re-use of effective prior survey methods and questions in new surveys." numbered="false" >}}</td>


The ability to “recycle” surveys is a crucial and often missing skill for music market, policy, and scientific research. An important contribution of CEEMID was the successful reuse of open cultural access and participation survey data for all European countries, leading to the creation of ex-ante harmonised, detailed cultural access and participation (CAP) surveys in Hungary, Slovakia, and Croatia. This will allow, for instance, the comparison of cultural access and participation live vs. online before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic, including differences between socio-demographic and values-based segments of the population.



## What Do We Offer To Scientific Partners? {#horizon-scientific-partners}

We provide exclusive scientific access to highly valuable quantitative datasets in music, particularly nationally representative audience surveys, nationally representative music creator surveys, and large music streaming data. We provide know-how and data science infrastructure that facilitates data collection via surveys or big data by utilizing pre-existing open science or open government sources.

<td style="text-align: center;">{{< figure src="/blogposts_2021/difficulty_bills_levels.jpg" caption="Compare nationally representative music audience, general population and music creator data." numbered="false" >}}</td>

We will provide researchers with data according to their needs, and make sure that their quantitative research will have the best scientific and policy impact. Our goal is to ensure our datasets meet higher quality standards than governmental statistics, and that they are the most findable open science resources in music globally.

## What Do We Offer To Policy Partners? {#horizon-policy-partners}

We want to demonstrate that we apply world-class research and the best and most data available to solve policy problems. If you bring your policy problem into an open collaboration with our Digital Music Observatory, you can rely on the expertise of eminent researchers in the field of economics, law, royalty finance, statistics, and valuable data. We want to demonstrate that we can offer the best value for money in data. 

We believe that our offering is particularly valuable for music policy organizations who would like to be actively involved in the shaping of the future [Feasibility Study For The Establishment Of A European Music Observatory](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/post/2020-11-16-european-music-observatory-feasibility/). Our Digital Music Observatory already contains much of the data gaps identified by stakeholders.  We have 7 years of working experience in the music industry, and we are familiar with data sharing and data governance solutions that manage well the conflicts of interests and strategic worries of the industry.

For copyright and neighbouring rights-holders and their organizations we can create music (royalty/tariff) valuations, euro value of the value gap, private copying, privacy – we have data and make estimates with all known music value estimation techniques. For live music organizations: Pan-European audience surveys; demographic comparisons of all European audiences; attendance predictions, attendance profiling. For granting authorities ---we have the world's largest survey-based dataset on how musicians work and live; we create ex ante needs assessment and grants evaluation indicators and ex-post grant evaluation indicators. For music export offices we can measure domestic and foreign market shares in streaming; we create actionable key performance indicators; and we do geographical targeting.
