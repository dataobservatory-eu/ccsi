**OpenMuse** brings together music industry stakeholders and researchers from 12 European countries. Our partners represent the diversity of the industry, as well as the shared need to find financially, socially, and environmentally sustainable policy and business models in multiple, sometimes-fragmented streams (e.g., live music, composers/publishers, and recordings with producers and performers).

OpenMuse is centerred around the [Digital Music Observatory](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/) as an open, scholarly data infrastructure that can be used both commercially and non-commercially. We want to replicate our success story in music in the broader creative and cultural industries.
