Surveyharmonies is a joint project of Reprex and Sinus. Reprex integrates open-source surveying tools, open-source software as a service, and open data as a service.  SINUS carries out survey design, fieldwork, and analysis on demand to maximize the value of survey recycling and the reuse of open data. Surveyharmonies unleashes the benefits of research automation, open science, and open data: you get more responses, higher quality datasets, and better documentation for less money. Surveyharmonies is an offering of Reprex with Sinus. 

## Value proposition

Surveyharmonies increase the value of your surveying work, whether self-managed or outsourced. 

- [x] `Unleash the power of open and linked data`: more data is collected by adding comparative answers from open datasets. You pay for one fieldwork and receive the output of many fieldworks.
 
- [x] `More information, more robust and valuable inference`: compare your respondent's answers with responses collected in other regions or earlier years. You gather data in one timeframe and region but receive data from more timeframes and many regions.
 
- [x] `Better connection, more users`: We make your work more usable and more citable with standardized metadata.  Your data products are easy to find, import, reuse, and cite.

- [x] `Higher data quality`: our data products are easier to review. We offer more tailored and cheaper quality control than proprietary survey providers. We use transparent, open, peer-reviewed algorithms.

- [x] Apply the best practices of `open science` or `open government` recommendations.

## Our services

Outsource services where you have no competitive in-house capacity. We aim to use only open-source components, so you can insource as much of the workflow as you can carry out in high-quality in-house. We integrate high-value survey design, fieldwork, data processing, analysis, and documentation services. 

While we thrive on being fully open-source, at this stage, we are still looking for good open-source solutions for carrying out fieldwork tasks. We support some widely used and inexpensive fieldwork applications like LimeSurvey or SurveyMonkey, or the fieldwork software of your choice. We support using Google Forms for simple activities because it is easy to use and free for end-users. 

## Offering
- [x] `For commercial partners and NGOs`:  we offer the best value for money with survey recycling. We unleash the power of open data and add already collected responses from taxpayer-funded research in the European Research Area or the United States. With a more limited offering, we work in other regions.

- [x] `For research consortia and projects`: we help you carry out your social sciences or digital humanities surveying tasks with the best value for money. For larger tasks, as consortium partners, and for smaller tasks (and retrospective data processing from pre-existing sources) as subcontractors.

- [x] `Data altruism`: we offer limited free services when our partners are willing to make the results open.
