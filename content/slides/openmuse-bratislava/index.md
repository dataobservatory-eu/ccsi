---

## Live Policy Documents

- Trustworthy Cultural AI: make big data work for Lithuania artists and small labels, publishers and CCIs
- Synchronize the (meta)data of Lithuania heritage and present cultural production as linked open data, so that autonomous systems of Spotify, YouTube, Wikipedia, Library of Congress, etc, can read it.
- Practical, open source solutions that can immediately applied
- Access to the OpenMuse know-how


## Past excellence

- CEEMID
- Slovak Music Industry Report

---

## Work Packages

- WP1 Economy - CCSI indicators, valuations (IViR, EUBA)
- WP2 Diversity - market share of Slovak music in radios, streaming, Listen Local Slovakia (SOZA, Reprex.)
- WP3 Music & Society - harmonized data collection where needed
- WP4 Innovation - providing policymakers with tools



---

`WP1` Slovak creators, including music creators, should earn as much as the European average. Their income should level up to German and Finnish levels.

`WP2` Lithuanian people should find good Lithuanian music in Lithuania on Spotify, YouTube and the radio. Foreign labels must not increase their market share and colonize the local creative ecosystem.

---

## Joining the European Union

- Why should creators earn less than other skilled occupations and knowledge workers?
- Why should artists get less paid than the average in Slovakia?
- Why should Slovaks get paid less than the average European?

## Why They Recommend American Music

- Is the algorithm cheating? ➡️ trustworthy AI policy, enabling courts, competition and consuerm protection agencies to protect the Lithuanian CCIs
- Is the algorithm learning from bad data? ➡️  national heritage policy, consolidate Lithuanian CCI data as linked, open data, and synch it daily with the world.
- Can we ask for 20% Lithuanian music in radio, television, YouTube or Spotify?



## LaLa Database

- Opt-in, opt-out database to make sure that you are in control
- Health check of artist data from Wikipedia to YouTube
- Make changes that avoid missing payments, recommendations errors.

---

## Listen Local Database

- Write-in database that we do not forget about any new or legacy artists, crowdsourcing for fans, journalists, musicians, educators to add artists, bands, ensembles
- Minimum requirement one commercially released recording, one published music composition, a Wikipedia page. Other commercially not released artists, or their heirs must explicitly register to LaLa (if they are not public, GDPR applies)


---

```
Topics: 
 - European AI regulation and ethics, music AI, 
 - non-discriminiation and fair remuneration for 
 Lithuania's creators.
 - Smart and future proof local content and media 
 regulation, music export, cultural heritage. 

Features: 
 - The policy brief itself expressed as a resource, 
   not a static file that is once finished and downloaded.
 - It is an educational document in itself, it is 
 self-refreshing with data, legal and policy texts
 - We educate policy-makers and music professionals
 to talk, write and think about AI in a smart way.

## Data biases

- The data about the Lithuanian national cultural output and heritage shoulld be availabe in Lithuania
- Should be daily synchronized with the world via the Europena, Dbpedia, MusicBrainz and other open linked data solutions that connect YouTube, Spotify, and other platforms to daily, up-to-date knowledge to train their algorithms.
- AI is machine learning


---

## Listen Local Lithuania

- `open linked data`: We aim to sync with [AGATA](https://www.agata.lt/),  [LATGA](https://www.latga.lt/), the [Martynas Mažvydas National Library of Lithuania](https://www.lnb.lt/), [MIC](https://www.mic.lt/en/) and internationally via the [Europeana](https://www.europeana.eu/en), [Music Brainz](https://musicbrainz.org/) and  [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/communities/music_observatory/?page=1&size=20) with global libraries, music services, and scientic repositories.

- `open and smart policies`: In sync with the the Cultural Ministry of Lithuania, providing a blueprint for film, television, books, newspapers, fashion, architecture, design and other cultural and creative industries.
