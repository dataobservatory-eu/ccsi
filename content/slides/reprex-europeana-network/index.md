- The [🖱️ CCSI Data Observatory](https://ccsi.dataobservatory.eu/) already has some data assets on Zenodo, and we can upgrade its API (both as Rest API with datacube and with a simple RDF serialization)
- We are creating high quality, SDMX compatible, linkable, open science data about cultural heritage objects and other cultural heritage policy data. We would like to connect on knowledge graphs to actual content.
- Revisit some modest deliverables of [🖱️ RECREO](https://ccsi.dataobservatory.eu/project/recreo/) and seek new funding.

- The [🖱️ CfR HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-01-03: Re-visiting the digitisation of cultural heritage: What, how and why?](https://ccsi.dataobservatory.eu/project/horizon/). Our appeal is to avoid duplication of cultural heritage and cultural industries digital infrastructure, and join forces with rights management, and commercial knowledge graphs to make heritage more reusable and valued.
- [🖱️ CfR HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-01-02: Cultural and creative industries for a sustainable climate transition](https://ccsi.dataobservatory.eu/project/horizon/). We have our open source software and app for environmental impact analysis and value chain analysis of the music industry that can be applied to the entire cultural sector.

## What are data observatories?

- There are more than 60 functional, and about 20 already discontinued data observatories, i.e. long-term, usually triangular (business, academic, policy) data collection institutions recognized by the EU, OECD or UNESCO, including the [European Observatory on Infringements of Intellectual Property Rights](https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/industry/strategy/intellectual-property/enforcement-intellectual-property-rights/european-observatory-infringements-intellectual-property-rights_en#:~:text=The%20European%20Observatory%20on%20Infringements,countries%2C%20businesses%20and%20civil%20society.) of the EU or the [European Audiovisual Observatory](https://www.obs.coe.int/en/web/observatoire) of the Council of Europe.

## Do it Smarter

- They usually do not exchange standard data with statistical agencies, they are not synchronized on knowledge graphs of the Europeana or national libraries, and their research output is usually not to be found on open science repositories.
- The Hague is the winner of the [World Smart City Award 2021](https://thehague.com/businessagency/the-hague-the-winner-world-smart-city-award-2021), and we would like to attract the planned European Music Observatory and other, EU/UNESCO recognized institutions into the town building on the innovations of Reprex and the ecosystem of the Hague.

## Strategic objectives

- Develop our data observatories as [Open Scholarly Infrastructure](https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/posse/).
- Place our [Digital Music Observatory](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/), [Cultural and Creative Data Observatory](https://ccsi.dataobservatory.eu/), and [Green Deal Data Observaotry](https://greendeal.dataobservatory.eu/) on knowledge graphs of Europeana, Wikidata, and other open knowledge systems.
- Harmonize research artefacts with open repositories such as Zenodo and Figshare.
- Achieve EU/UNESCO/OECD recognition for our self-governing, triangular, science-policy-bushiness triangular data ecosystems as *data observatories*.

## Possible Collaboration

<span style="font-size:75%">

- Connect national collective management organization, national library, and various services (Spotify, YouTube) to make the national repertoire more visible

- Create use statistics for cultural diversity policies and monitoring local content regulations

- Provide best practice example and open source tools for replication

- Support research automation 

</span>

## Web 3.0 & FAIR

<span style="font-size:75%">

- FAIR metadata: Dublin Core & DataCite referential metadata

- Integration to FigShare and Zenodo for automated releases and publications

- Supported with optional, open source APIs to retrieve the data

- Supported with RDF serialization
</span>

## Dissemination Support

<span style="font-size:75%">

-  Support automated publishing and releasing of data, visualizations, newsletters, and long-form documentation in auto-refreshing websites, blogposts, or articles, or even books.

- 	Develop an ecosystem of open source software that helps the professional collection, processing, documentation of data conforming the Data Governance Act, and supporting data sharing and data altruism.
