Europe, like most regions of the world, is a net importer of music, but has very signficant export potential. Intra-European export is also very significant, especially from Germany, France, Sweden and the Netherlands.

The Central and Eastern European region is relatively weak in exporting recorded and live performances, but it is among global leaders in creating export revenues from festivals.

Currently I am involved in creating predicitve models that help finding the best potential foreign market for music, and I make economic impact assessments of cultural tourism.
